            <p>Hello! My name is Erin Campbell and I am a Computer Science major and a Data Science minor at the College of William & Mary.
                I am currently pursuing a career in tech, such as in the field of data and Human-Computer Interaction, for the Summer or Fall of 2025. My experience
                as a coding consultant for undergraduate computer science students has lead me to develop excellent problem-solving and 
                communication skills. My experience as a front desk attendent at multiple companies has greatly improved my communication skills 
                as well, and I am a patient and diligent collaborator.
            </p>
